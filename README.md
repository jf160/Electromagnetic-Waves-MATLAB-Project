# Electromagnetic-Waves-MATLAB-Project
For this project I was tasked with designing a quarter wave transformer on a microstrip line at a specific design frequency. This project was completed for Applied Electromagnetic Waves (ECE 3317) with Professor Jackson at the University of Houston (Fall 2020). This repository is private and is only meant to archive this projects completion. Also in this repository you will find my project write up and the MATLAB code that was used to generate the plots.
